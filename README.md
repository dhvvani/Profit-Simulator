# Profit-Simulator
Given a file that has orders, vary the number of workers to see which employee line maximizes profit.

The C++ simulator will show the varied profit the a business can make given they have standard and primero(prioritised) customers on a sequence of orders that arrive at the business at different times/days. It allows the owner to see the best workflow required to ship orders out on time and also leave them with the least expense in terms of paying wages. 
Note that for the simulator to work correctly, the input file of orders must consist of lines in the following format:
  [TIME] [TYPE] [COST]

An example file to reference to is in the repository as "test.txt". The purpose of the program was to highlight object-oriented programming, class hierarchy and code duplication reduction.
